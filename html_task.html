        <h1>Introduction to ARM processors & its types and Overview to Cortex M series with deep explanation of each of the processors in this Family</h1>
    </center>
    <h2 padding=0px>ARM:</h2>
    <p align="justify"> &emsp; &emsp; As predicted by Moore in his law, there is an increase in new technologies in every field, same way ARM has produced a number of processors by incorporating those new technologies resulting in good or even better processors with respect
        to the intended type of applications. These processors are classified into three types based on the application domains that they come under,</p>
    <ul>
        <li align="justify">
            <b>Microcontroller Processors:</b> These types of processors were normally designed to provide high performance by maximizing the energy efficiency in lower silicon area. Usually these processors have lower maximum frequency (less than 200MHz
            and some will be beyond that) till now Cortex M series is one of the best examples for this type because of its ease of use that were intended deeply for embedded systems.</li>
        <br>
        <li align="justify"><b>Real-time Processors:</b> These types of processors are designed for high performance in real-time applications such as Heart pacemaker, Hard disk controller, Airline Traffic Control Systems etc.., Most of these wonâ€™t contain Memory Management
            Unit(MMU) instead they have Memory Protection Unit(MPU) and of-course other features for industrial applications. They can work at a moderate clock frequency (200MHz to less than 1GHz). The response latency is very low. Many small Real Time
            Operating Systems(RTOS) can be used with this type of processor but full versions of large OS like Windows or Linux are not supported.</li>
        <br>
        <li align="justify"><b>Application Processors:</b> These types of processor are for high end purposes including servers most commonly smartphones and mobile computing. They operate at higher clock frequencies (More than 1GHz). It supports MMU, which results in the
            use of full version OS like Windows, Android, Linux</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cortex-M Series</h3>
    <p align="justify"> &emsp; &emsp; This series is mostly focused on obtaining inexpensive and energy-efficient microprocessors. These processors are designed for microcontrollers that can be utilized in a range of applications, including the Internet of Things, embedded
        systems, industrial applications, and daily consumer products.</p>

                <dd align="justify"> &emsp; &emsp; It is the first processor in this series, which was built using a small silicon area that is able to operate in low power. The instruction set was composed of only 56 instructions where most of the instructions were 16 bits,
                    however registers and the data are operated in 32 bits. It enables to achieve 32 bit processes in just 8bit price range. It is composed of a low gate count starting from 12k gates. <b><a href="https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu/cortex-m/cortex-m0" target="_blank">Click Here</a></b>                    for more Information</dd>

                <dd align="justify"> &emsp; &emsp; As a result of the success of the M0 processor in the industry M0+ had been introduced. The same instruction set and tool compatibility as the M0 CPU, but with lower energy consumption and higher performance than the M0 processor.

                <dd align="justify"> &emsp; &emsp; It was the first processor that was designed mainly for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). Therefore, the targeted audience were those who wanted FPGA devices, as it also contains FPGA synthesis tools which allows the
                    user or designer to choose their processor with reduced implementation for their project. It has a low gate count. <b><a href="https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu/cortex-m/cortex-m1" target="_blank">Click Here</a></b> for more

                <dd align="justify"> &emsp; &emsp; It was developed mainly by considering producing a processor with increased performance in the low cost range. It includes low interrupt latency, low cost debug and low gate count that operates in low power. As previously
                    said, it was designed primarily for embedded applications that demand quick interrupt requests. <b><a href="https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu/cortex-m/cortex-m3" target="_blank">Click Here</a></b> for more Information</dd>

                    One of the most important features that was introduced is this is Floating Point Unit (FPU); it is an optional. It was created to meet the needs of digital signal processing, which required a processor that could combine control and
                    signal processing in an easy-touse manner. Demanded industries are automotive, Power management, motor control, embedded audio and industrial automation markets. Both the M4 processor without FPU and the M4 processor with FPU are designed
                    specifically for embedded applications that demand quick interrupt response. <b><a href="https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu/cortex-m/cortex-m4" target="_blank">Click Here</a></b> for more Information</dd>

                <dd align="justify"> &emsp; &emsp; It is the processor with the highest performance in the M series, approximately double the performance provided by the M4. This processor enables the designing of sophisticated Memory Control Unit and System on Chip. It provides
                    industry-leading scalar performance of 5.01 CoreMarks/MHz while keeping the Armv7-M architecture's great responsiveness and ease of use. From this processor onwards the instructions and the data buses are increased to 64 bits rather
                    than 32 bits. With the built in instructions, Tightly Coupled Memories and data caches this superscalar processor never slows down its performance, even during high end computation and most demand application processing. <b><a href="https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu/cortex-m/cortex-m7" target="_blank">Click Here</a></b>                    for more Information

                    assign or specify the trusted and untrusted applications running on them. <b><a href="https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu/cortex-m/cortex-m23" target="_blank">Click Here</a></b> for more Information</dd>
